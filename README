I do know this repository will have some tiny projects I found online and decided to copy/tweak to my own likings. Basically something to get me started on Python again.

Will edit later. Not sure how to credit people, but w/e, we'll figure out as we go.

## Random stuff you will find here

- [x] 1. [Timed Math](001-timed-math) -> [Tech With Tim](https://youtu.be/NpmFbWO6HPU?t=8104)
    - Tinkering a bit with `random` and `time` packages.
- [x] 2. [Ten Fox Fingers](002-ten-fox-fingers) -> [Tech With Tim](https://youtu.be/NpmFbWO6HPU?t=15189)
    - Yes, it's a stupid pun on "10fastfingers.com" :fox:
    - In hindsight, this should have been named **typefox**...
        - Name seems to be trademarked. Funny.
    - Tinkering with `curses` and some formatting stuff.
    - [ ] Some refactoring and personal additions left to make.
