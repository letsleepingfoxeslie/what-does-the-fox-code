Oye, Beltalowda. Listen up. This is your Captain, and this is your ship. This is YOUR moment.
You might think that you're scared, but you're not. That isn't fear.
That's your sharpness. That's your power.
We are Belters. Nothing in the void is foreign to us. The place we go is the place we belong.
This is no different. No one has more right to this, none more prepared.
Inyalowda go through the Ring, call it their own, but a Belter opened it.
We are the Belt. We are strong, we are sharp, and we don't feel fear. This moment belong to us.
For Beltalowda! Beltalowda!!
You followed your conscience in the hope that others would follow theirs.
You didn’t do it for a reward, or a pat on the head.
The universe never tells us if we did right or wrong.
It’s more important to try to help people than to know that you did.
More important that someone else’s life gets better than for you to feel good about yourself.
You never know the effect you might have on someone, not really.
Maybe one core thing you said haunts them forever.
Maybe one moment of kindness gives them comfort or courage.
Maybe you said the one thing they needed to hear.
It doesn’t matter if you never know. You just have to try.
The stars are better off without us.
Doors and corners, kid. That's where they get you.
And bad men do things believing it’s for the good of all mankind.

This is the warship Rocinante.
We'll all die together. This is our only and final warning: Stay clear.
If life transcends death, then I will seek for you there. If not, then there too.
War is an inherently unstable interaction of three things: intense emotion, politics, and luck.
